this is the structure of the database
this way it's easy to query for:
- event hosted by a specific NDI team, at a specific location (country, city...), in a specific year
- user
- users' scores at a specific event (each event contains data: host, country, city...)
also, it's easier to add more data points to a user:
gender: "female",
