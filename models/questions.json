Match argument to persuasion technique (i.e. Statement A <-> pathos)
Proposal Example: The government should implement a tax on pollution to create a healthier environment.
Ethos (Ethics) - We have an obligation to protect other species and the planet for our children and future generations.
Pathos (Emotion) - Pollution causes animals to suffocate and die, birds to be covered with tar and unable to fly and disease for our nation.
Logos (Logic) - Pollution is a systemic risk to our ecosystem, causing thousands of children to become ill each year, which results in millions of dollars in medical bills.

Proposal Example: Teachers should be paid a higher wage.
Ethos (Ethics) - Researchers illustrate that paying teachers more increases long-term socioeconomic gains for students and their families which we need to increase the prosperity of our country.
Pathos (Emotion) - Teachers often work long hours and spend more time with their students than their own family. Teachers have the added responsibility of educating the future generation.
Logos (Logic) - 75% of teachers take home 20% less than they need to support themselves and their families.

Proposal Example: The death penalty is an unjustified method of punishment.
Ethos (Ethics) - According to researchers, the death penalty does not deter crime and we as citizens can utilize more human methods to rehabilitate those that break the law.
Pathos (Emotion) - Innocent lives are taken by the death penalty and families are forced to deal with the trauma of losing a loved one.
Logos (Logic) - In 10% of death penalty cases, innocent people are mistakenly identified as guilty.
